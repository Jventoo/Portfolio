- Designed, engineered, and shipped a monotonic AI level of difficulty system that scales bot skill using designer curves and helped increase Day 1 retention.
- Created an aim randomization system that interfaces with my previously created level of difficulty system, further helping increase Day 1 retention.
- Refactored aiming models to support different target types (humans, tanks, helicopters, etc).
- Engineered a proprietary perception framework based on Epic's original Unreal implementations with better scalability and 12% performance gains.
- Promoted to _Gameplay Engineer_ in Sep 2021 from _Gameplay Engineer Intern_, inheriting more systems like equipment, aiming, targeting, and more.
