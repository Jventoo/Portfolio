Scifi FPS prototype built in UE4. The primary goal of this project was to reverse engineer Epicâ€™s Shooter Game sample and thoroughly learn UE4 in the process.  
My additions include incorporating the GameplayTags to enable lightweight, realtime tracking, improving passive AI behavior, and tweaking projectile weapon physics.
