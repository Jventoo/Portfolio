Trailblazer Crisis is an unfinished scifi adventure game where the player takes to space on an expedition to find Humanity a new home.

The game features:  
Carefully scripted narrative influenced by passive & active player choice, weighty weapon handling, advanced locomotion (mantling & foot/hand IK), NPCs that react to the playerâ€™s combat and narrative choices in real time, and incredible accessibility and control options.
