Instant Wrapped is a Spotify integrated web application that allows users to generate listening statistics for a number of time periods, create playlists from their results, and compare their libraries with other users.  
Built for CSE 183, it uses py4web on the backend, Vue & Bulma on the frontend, and Google Cloud for deployment.
