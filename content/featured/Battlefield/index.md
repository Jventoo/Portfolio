Built from the ground up to be a standalone entry in the franchise, Battlefield Mobile is a fully-fledged, skill-based experience coming to iOS & Android.

As a gameplay engineer at Industrial Toys, I'm primarily working on bots that monotonically scale their intelligence with difficulty, as well as interacting with a number of other systems (mainly weapons, equipment, movement).
