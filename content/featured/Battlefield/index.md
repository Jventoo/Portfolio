Built from the ground up to be a standalone Battlefield game, _Battlefield Mobile_ is a fully-fledged AAA FPS for iOS & Android.

As a **gameplay engineer** at **EA Industrial Toys**, I'm primarily working on bots (utility AI, perception, combat, equipment, and more), as well as interacting with with other gameplay systems (e.g. weapons, movement, game-modes). See my resume for more!
