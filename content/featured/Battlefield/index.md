Built from the ground up to be a standalone entry in the franchise, Battlefield Mobile is a fully-fledged, skill-based experience coming to iOS & Android.

As a gameplay engineer at Industrial Toys, I'm primarily working on bots (utility AI, perception, combat, equipment, and more), as well as interacting with a number of other systems (weapons, movement, game-modes). See my resume for more!
