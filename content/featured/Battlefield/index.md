Built from the ground up to be a standalone entry in the franchise, Battlefield Mobile is a fully-fledged, skill-based experience coming to iOS & Android.

As a gameplay engineer at Industrial Toys, I'm primarily working on bots, as well as interacting with a number of other systems (mainly weapons, equipment, movement). For the AI team, I've been responsible for creating a proprietary perception framework, a monotonically scaling difficulty system, aim randomization, and more systems.
